    A menu that provides filtering functionality.

    How the menu's filter options are built:
        A QSortFilterProxyModel is set for the menu, and the filter menu options reflect the data
        in the model. The menu's FilterDefinition processes the model data and constructs a dictionary
        of data that contains the filter data for each of the model items. The FilterDefintion is then
        used to populate the menu with the filter QAction/QWidgetAction items.

    When the menu is updated/refreshed:
        The filter menu is refreshed based on the current model data on showing the menu, to ensure
        the filter options reflect the current model data accurately. The menu is also refreshed
        when the filter options are modified, which changes the model data. The menu may also be
        forced to be refreshed on calling the `refresh` method with param `force` as True.

    Example usage::

        # Create the menu
        filter_menu = FilterMenu(parent)

        # Set the proxy model that contains the data to be filtered on. This must be called
        # before the menu is initialized since the menu requires a model to build the filter
        # items (if there is no model, there will be no filter options. The proxy model must
        # inherit from the QSortFilterProxyModel class.
        #
        # If 'connect_signals' is True, the filter model is also expected to have the method
        # 'set_filter_items'; the FilterItemProxyModel and FilterItemTreeProxyModel classes
        # implement this method, and are designed to work with this FilterMenu class.
        #
        # If `connect_signals` is not True, the caller will need to connect to the signal
        # `filters_changed` signal, which the menu emits, when filters have been modified and
        # the proxy model requires updating.
        filter_menu.set_filter_model(proxy_model, connect_signals=True)

        # Initialize the menu. This will clear the menu and set up the static menu actions (e.g.
        # "Clear Filters", "More Filters") and refresh the menu to display available filter
        # options (if the model has any data loaded).
        filter_menu.initialize_menu()

        # Create a QToolButton and set the filter menu on it. The FilterMenuButton class is not
        # required, any QToolButton class may be used. The benefit of the FilterMenuButton class
        # is that it is designed to work with the FilterMenu specfically, for example, the icon
        # will be updated when the menu has active filtering to visually indicate the data is
        # filtered.
