        a list of Version entity dictionaries as returned by the Shotgun
        Python API. The text key contains the string labels of the action

        or "either". Any action requiring a "single" selection will be enabled
        only if there is a single item selected in the Version list view,
        those requiring "multi" selection require 2 or more selected items,
        and the "either" requirement results in the action being enabled if
        one or more items are selected.
