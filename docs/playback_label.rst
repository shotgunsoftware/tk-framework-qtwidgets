ShotGrid Playback Label Widget
#############################################

The ShotGrid Playback Label is a simple ``QLabel`` override which
makes it easy to indicate that a thumbnail can be played back:

.. image:: images/playback_label.png

The widget takes care of analyzing provided ShotGrid data, and in
case the ShotGrid data contains playable media, the playback icon will
automatically appear. Clicking the playback icon will launch a
playback action, currently launching ShotGrid screening room in a web browser.

.. note:: In order to use this widget in QT designer, you need to wrap
    the import in a module. For more information on how to do this, see :ref:`widgets-in-designer`.

Use the label like this::

    playback_label = sgtk.platform.import_framework("tk-framework-qtwidgets", "playback_label")

    # construct label object
    label =  playback_label.ShotgunPlaybackLabel(parent_widget)

    # always use label with a pixmap
    label.setPixmap(some_pixmap_object)

    # pass a ShotGrid data dictionary to tell the label what data we are
    # operating on. Make sure to include relevant fields - for example,
    # if you are passing version data, make sure to include media fields
    label.set_shotgun_data(sg_data)

    # we can check if an icon is displayed
    print "Playback icon displayed: %s" % label.playbable

    # and we can hook it up to other things
    label.playback_clicked.connect(some_callback)



.. currentmodule:: playback_label

.. autoclass:: ShotgunPlaybackLabel
    :show-inheritance:
    :members: set_shotgun_data, playable
