Shotgun Note editor widget
#############################################

The note editor widget makes it easy to add notes in Toolkit.

You can use the widget either to create or reply to notes. The editor
includes screen grabbing capabilities and a user name auto completer.
If you start typing @xyz, an auto completer will kick in and show matching
groups and users. Once added to the note text, these users will automatically
be included in the TO list in the case of a new note and in the CC list in the
case of a reply.
