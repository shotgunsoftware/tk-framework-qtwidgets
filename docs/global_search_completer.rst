Shotgun Global Search Completer
#############################################

The global search completer is a QCompleter instance for use with widgets
that allow input of Shotgun entities. The completer can be customized to 
search across a given set of entity types. 

Once a user selects an object, a signal fires to indicate that an entity
was activated.
